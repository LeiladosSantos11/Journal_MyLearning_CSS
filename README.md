# Journal_MyLearning_CSS

When I started learning web development I asked the Bootcamp's teacher: 
"What was the best to use px, rem or em". 
He replied: 
"Just pick one and stick with it." 
FYI he didn't have a clue what was rem or em. 

Is what I did since then, I used just pixels on my projects because it worked and was realiable. However, when I started to understand a bit more about accessibility or responsive design I noticed that I couldn't figure out why the h1 heading didn't change on the small screens...which was very annoying. So I did what the web developers professionals do most on their daily job:

Research, googling, experimenting until I found my answers.

This article will go deep on pixels and accessibility. I hope you will enjoy it:
